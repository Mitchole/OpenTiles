# Learner Profile

## Identity
- **Name**: Jake Mitchell
- **Start Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Foundations) — Term 1, Week 1

## Experience Level
- **Programming**: Complete beginner
- **Web Development**: None
- **Game Development**: None
- **Technical Background**: Software support, 9 years customer service, never past first line level.

## Goals

### Primary Goal
Build **OpenTiles**—a Piano Tiles clone with:
1. Full-stack web platform (React frontend, Node.js backend)
2. Unity game implementation (C#)

### Project Locations
- **Learning system**: `OpenTiles/learning/`
- **Web project**: `OpenTiles/dev/web/`
- **Unity project**: `OpenTiles/dev/unity/`

### Learning Objectives
- Master web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Build production React applications
- Create Node.js/Express backends with databases
- Learn C# and Unity basics for game development

### Timeline
- **Target Duration**: 18-24 months
- **Weekly Commitment**: 10-15 hours

## Constraints
- Self-taught (no bootcamp/formal instruction)
- Learning alongside work/life responsibilities
- Must avoid tutorial hell and AI dependency

## Learning Preferences
- **Preferred session length**: Variable (45 min - 5+ hours depending on focus state)
- **Schedule**: ~2 hours daily, one midweek break day, longer weekend sessions
- **Weekly capacity**: 14-18 hours (exceeds minimum target)
- **ADHD considerations**:
  - Needs variety within sessions
  - Benefits from early visual wins
  - Hyperfocus potential is an asset when channeled
  - Clear stopping points essential for easy re-entry
- **Preferred explanation style**: [TBD - observe in sessions]
- **Response to struggle**: [TBD - observe in sessions]

## Core Motivation
Frustrated by ad-filled free games on Android. Wants to build a Piano Tiles clone where users can create and import custom track files to play different songs. The user-generated content/sharing aspect is the emotional core of the project — connects to Phase 4-5 backend work.

## Anti-Patterns to Watch
- Over-reliance on AI for solutions
- Passive tutorial consumption without building
- Skipping JavaScript fundamentals for React
- Avoiding error messages/debugging
- **Routine dropout**: Primary risk factor. Consistency is the challenge, not comprehension. System must provide external structure and connect fundamentals to OpenTiles vision frequently.

## North Star
> Build OpenTiles from scratch, understanding every line of code written.
> The goal is competency, not just completion.
