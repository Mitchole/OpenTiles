## Session Brief (Term Orchestrator)

### Session 1 Brief — Friday, Dec 19

**Module**: HTML Foundations
**Planned Duration**: ~2 hours
**Connection to Previous**: First session — no prior context

#### Today's Objectives
1. Create an HTML file in VS Code and open it in a browser
2. Understand what HTML is and why it exists
3. Write basic tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`) and see them render

#### Context for Session Teacher
- **Current skill level**: Complete beginner, no prior web development
- **Recent struggles**: N/A (first session)
- **Learning preferences**: ADHD — needs variety, early visual wins, clear stopping points
- **Motivation anchor**: Connect HTML to future OpenTiles UI ("this is how you'll build the game interface")

#### Suggested Approach
1. **Hook (5 min)**: Explain that every website Jake has ever used is built with HTML — including the Piano Tiles games he wants to replace
2. **Quick win (10 min)**: Create a file, add `<h1>Hello</h1>`, open in browser — immediate visible result
3. **Explore (30 min)**: Experiment with `<p>`, multiple headings, see what happens with/without tags
4. **Build (45 min)**: Create hello.html with name and bio, using Socratic method
5. **Wrap (10 min)**: Learner explains what each tag does, assign between-session task

#### Build Challenge
**Task**: Create `hello.html` with:
- Your name as a heading
- 2-3 sentences about yourself in paragraphs

**Success criteria**:
- File renders correctly in browser
- Can explain what `<h1>` and `<p>` do without looking at notes

#### Pre-Session Prep
- Ensure VS Code is installed with Live Server extension
- Create `dev/web/` folder if it doesn't exist

## Notes (Term Orchestrator)

- **ADHD accommodation**: Sessions should mix explanation with immediate hands-on coding. Avoid long passive segments.
- **Motivation anchor**: Connect HTML structure to future OpenTiles UI
- **Routine support**: Each session ends with clear "next action" for easy re-entry
